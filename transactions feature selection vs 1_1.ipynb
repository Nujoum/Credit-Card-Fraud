    "This feature selection notebook does a filter followed by a wrapper for a binary dependent variable (binary classification). It's capable of doing the filter on more than one file. The variable files are called vars1.csv, vars2.csv. The filter runs separately on each vars file and keeps the top num_filter variables from each file. If there are more than one vars files we'll again select the top num_filter variables across all the vars.csv files.\n",

In cell 2 I set the name of the record identifying number (I used a record number to keep track of things) and the name of the binary dependent variable. This particular version is set for a fraud problem.\n",

    "I made sure my validation/out-of-time population and any other record exclusion is set correctly and as I want for the problem in cell 3. This define the records in the data file that I for whatever reason don't want to include in the feature selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell 20 has the SequentialFeatureSelector (SFS) settings. I tried different wrapper models with different amounts of commplexity. I selected either forward or backward. The filter is pretty fast. The wrapper is what takes the most time. I found forward selection runs much faster than backward.\n",

    "There's a parameter njobs that controls the # threads used in the wrapper. I set it to 1 for a single thread which works fine, but with njobs = -1, it lets the machine set the maximum # threads based on the CPU. However, with this setting the kernel may die because of memory. The njobs = -1 doesn't take into consideration the memory requirements.\n"
